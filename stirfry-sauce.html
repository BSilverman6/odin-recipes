      <p>This Stirfry sauce is super flavorful and versatile. It's got the right amount of heat, sweet, and salty. Add it to your cooking pot just when the veggies are almost cooked and it'll cook them the last bit. Make extra if you want your rice to pick up such a great sauce!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <!-- Unordered List -->
      <ul>
        <li>1/4 Cup Soy Sauce (or Tamari for Gluten Free)</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup acid (Lime Juice, Rice Vinegar, neutral vinegar, or some combination of the previous)*</li>
        <li>1 Ts Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Ts Grated Ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tb Sriracha</li>
        <li>1 Tb Honey</li>
        <li>1 Tb Corn Starch</li>
        <li>1.5 Tb Water</li>
      </ul>
      <p>*I Like to add a splash of Mirin to this for sweetness</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <!-- Ordered List -->
      <ol>
        <li>Mix all ingredients together until sauce is homogenous</li>
        <li>Add to Cooked Vegetables and proteins* and stir in Wok</li>
        <li>Serve over rice**</li>
      </ol>

      <p>**1 Cup Uncooked Rice will suffice to match the amount of stir fry when rice is cooked</p>
